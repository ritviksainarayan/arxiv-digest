    "🏃‍♀️ Step by step, paper by paper. You're literally ascending while reading about the cosmos. Iconic.",
    "⭐ Here you are, staying up-to-date on your literature review. Nice work!",
    "🚀 Cardio + astro-ph = an insane form of multitasking. You're a rockstar.",
    "🌟 Fun fact: reading papers on a stepmill burns mass, just like a star. You're basically a main sequence queen.",
    "💪 Other people scroll Instagram at the gym. You read about stellar evolution. We are not the same.",
    "🔭 Your heart rate is up, your knowledge is expanding. The universe is proud of you.",
    "✨ Every step you take is one step closer to tenure and one step up the stepmill. Synergy!",
    "🌙 The Moon's escape velocity is 2.38 km/s. Your's must be higher because NOTHING can stop you.",
    "⚡ You're generating more power than a brown dwarf right now. Keep climbing!",
    "🍕 You could be eating pizza in bed. But no. You're on the stepmill. Reading about LITHIUM DEPLETION.",
    "🌠 Somewhere, a committee is meeting without you. But you? You're ASCENDING the stepmill.",
    "💫 Hot take: the stepmill is just a really boring rocket. You're training for space.",
    "🏔️ Sir Edmund Hillary climbed Everest. You're climbing a stepmill in Wisconsin. Both required questionable judgment and excellent cardiovascular fitness.",
    "🔥 Your VO2 max called. It said 'thank you for the gains and the gyrochronology.'",
    "🎢 This is the only acceptable way to read about rotational evolution.",
    "🎪 Welcome to the circus: you're a tenure-track professor reading arXiv on a stepmill at 6am. The clown makeup is optional.",
    "🔭 In the time it takes you to finish this stepmill session, light from the Sun will have traveled about 2.4 AU. You will have traveled about 40 floors. Both are valid units of progress.",
    "💪 Sisyphus pushed a boulder up a hill for eternity, but did he do it while reading astro-ph?",
    "☕ You could be drinking hot cocoa and relaxing. Instead you're sweating and reading about chromospheric activity. Your choices are questionable.",
    "🧗 The stepmill has no summit. The literature has no end. Your dedication has no explanation. We climb anyway.",
    "🎰 Every paper is a slot machine. Will it be relevant? Will it scoop you? Will it cite you? Spin the wheel. Read the abstract. Feel something.",
    "🚿 You will forget 80% of these abstracts by the time you shower. This is not a personal failing. This is the human condition. We read anyway.",
    "🔬 Studies show that reading papers on a stepmill increases comprehension by 0%. But it does make you feel like a high-achieving weirdo, and honestly that's worth something.",
    "🌙 Tonight's forecast: 85% chance of you lying awake thinking about that one weird result in paper #3. But that's future you's problem."
